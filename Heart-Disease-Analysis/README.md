# Heart-Disease-Analysis
Converting a dataset to a dataframe and sql database and performing analysis and visualization

Converter: This will turn the csv file on heart disease to a .db file and a pandas dataframe that can then be imported to the unified analysis file.

Unified: Merge of all other files for discussion and visualization of features in the dataset.

Requirements: This is the first time I was able to get a requirements file up and running, so here's hoping it works for everyone!

heart_data_cleaned: This is the csv containing the data.

Bits and pieces folder: All the separate bits of analysis that were stitched together to form the unified file.
